# OpenCV_learning_notes
This is a OpenCV learning repository. 

# Install and set the OpenCV in ubuntu environment
The OpenCV source code cannot be directly used like the Windows platform using the VS code or Viusal Studio. It needs to download it from the [OpenCV website](https://opencv.org/releases/) and related [OpenCV contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/releases). After downloaded it from the website, in the ubuntu, it can be realised by using the 'CMake' to compile it. There are lots of information about how to install the OpenCV into the Ubuntu.

Compunded the two instructions, there may be lots of puzzles are solved. 

## How to use the CLion to code your OpenCV applications
The CLion is a cross-platform IDE and it provides lots of useful tools for easily compiling. The most important thing in the Unix platform to develop the C++ application is that how to write the 'CMakeLists.txt'. Here is some demo to teach writing the CMakeLists.
